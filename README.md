# Technical Test @uplearn

This repository contains the two exercices for the technical test for the analytics engineer position @uplearn. 

[ex-1-sql](ex-1-sql/test_uplearn.sql) contains a file for the sql questions

[ex-2-modelling](ex-2-modelling/) has a self contained dbt environment for the data model, with instructions on how to run if desired and an overview of the data model. I know it wasn't necessary but I wanted to play a bit with lightdash as did not have the chance to properly test it in the past. Also it's easy for me to imagine a data model if it's tangible and I've had the chance to play a bit with the data.

Do not hesitate to send any questions to my email or open an issue! :)
